## Day 1: Introduction to Python, Installation, and Configuration

### Objectives

- Understand the role of Python in DevOps.
- Install Python and set up a development environment.
- Write and execute your first Python program.

### Prerequisites

1. **Basic Understanding of Programming Concepts**: Familiarity with basic programming concepts will be helpful, but not required. If you need a refresher, consider watching the following video:
   - [Programming Basics - What is Programming?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkJk4tX3cIU) (YouTube)

2. **Basic Command Line Skills**: Knowledge of how to use the command line interface (CLI) is useful for setting up Python. If you're new to the CLI, check out:

### Installation and Setup

1. **Install Python**:
   - Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version of Python.
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:
     - **Windows**: Run the installer and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH".
     - **macOS**: Python is pre-installed on macOS. To install a newer version, use Homebrew: `brew install python`.
     - **Linux**: Use your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3` for Ubuntu.

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open your command line interface and type `python --version` or `python3 --version` to confirm Python is installed correctly.
   - You should see the installed Python version.

3. **Set Up a Development Environment**:
   - Install a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Some popular choices include:
     - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
     - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
     - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

   - Optionally, set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
     ```bash
     python -m venv myenv
     source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

### Write Your First Python Program

1. **Create a Python Script**:
   - Open your text editor or IDE and create a new file named `hello.py`.

2. **Write the Code**:
   - Add the following code to `hello.py`:
     ```python
     print("Hello, DevOps!")
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Open your command line interface and navigate to the directory containing `hello.py`.
   - Run the script with:
     ```bash
     python hello.py
     ```
   - You should see `Hello, DevOps!` printed to the terminal.
